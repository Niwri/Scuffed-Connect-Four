# Scuffed-Connect-Four

Alrighty so uh,

This python game was designed using Zelle's graphics.py. You could explore more here: https://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/

Uses a single thread, so the game's pretty janked...

Welp, that kinda covers everything up.

Oh ye, I also packaged it into an executable (.exe), which is in the zip file.
